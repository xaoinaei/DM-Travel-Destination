The city is sure to charm you with its eclectic mix of the old and new &ndash; from magnificent monuments to bustling Old Delhi markets and stunning high rises.</p>

<p><strong>Day </strong><strong>2 :</strong><strong> A day in Delhi</strong><br />
Full day excursion to Old and New Delhi, exploring the medieval and pre-modern faces of the historic capital of India personified by the Jama Masjid and Chandni Chowk (closed on Sundays). Take a food walk in the Chandni Chowk market. In Afternoon visit Humayun&rsquo;s Tomb and Qutub Minar. Overnight in the hotel.</p>

<p><strong>Jama Masjid </strong>is a mosque in Old Delhi, constructed in 1650&ndash;56 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān, a noted patron of Islamic architecture whose most famous work is the Taj Mahal, in Agra.</p>

<p>This vibrant market came to existence when the fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, shifted his capital from Agra to Shahjahanabad, now Old Delhi, in the mid 17th century. While Chandni Chowk or the moonlit square no longer bears the magnificence of the bygone era, its importance in the annals of Delhi will never be lost.</p>

<p>The <strong>food walk in Old Delhi </strong>is a great experience to and the best way to see and taste Old Delhi. The dishes one can savor in Old Delhi Food Walk are large, thick and juicy jalebis, glistening with ghee; Aloo chaat crisp fried potato cutlets dunked in a melange of chutneys and smattered with onions and spices ; varieties of stuffed paranthas potato, onion, cottage cheese, cauliflower, radish, dry fruits and many more&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>Humanyun&rsquo;s Tomb </strong>was built in 1565 A.D. nine years after the death of Humayun, by his senior widow Bega Begam. Inside the walled enclosure the most notable features are the garden squares (chaharbagh) with pathways water channels, centrally located well proportional mausoleum topped by double dome.</p>

<p><strong>Qutab Minar </strong>is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately after the defeat of Delhi&#39;s last Hindu kingdom. The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony</p>

It was in Agra that the artistic excellence of the Mughals reached its zenith at a time that coincided with the political high water mark of their vast and expanding empire.</p>

<p><strong>Agra Fort </strong>was begun by Akbar between 1565 and 1573. It is situated on the west bank of the Yamuna River, about 2km upstream from the Taj Mahal.&nbsp; Akbar built the fort of sandstone; his grandson Shah Jahan, the builder of the Taj Mahal, constructed palaces of white marble within the fort itself.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mehtab Bagh </strong>or the moonlight garden, was the last of the eleven Mughal-built gardens along the Yamuna river opposite to the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort. Built during the period 1631- 1635 A.D., Mehtab Bagh literally means &ldquo;a moonlit pleasure garden&rdquo;.</p>

Alternating between dry deciduous forests and swathes of grasslands, the Ranthambore National Park is recognised as one of the best places in the country to spot tigers.</p>
