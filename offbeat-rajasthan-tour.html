  <h2><i class="fa fa-bars fa-lg"></i> Detailed Itinerary</h2>
  </div>
  <p> <p><strong>Day 1 : Arrive Delhi</strong><br />
  Arrive in Delhi today and get transferred in a private vehicle to your hotel where accommodation is held from 1400 hrs. Check-in and spend the rest of the day to explore the bustling national capital. Overnight stay in Hotel Suncourt Yatri.</p>
  
  <p>Delhi offers a harmonious blend of architecture and history. From remnants of the Mughal empire and British Raj to contemporary India, you can experience it all in the capital. The city is sure to charm you with its eclectic mix of the old and new &ndash; from magnificent monuments to bustling Old Delhi markets and stunning high rises.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Day 2 : A day in Delhi</strong><br />
  Full day excursion to Old and New Delhi, exploring the medieval and pre-modern faces of the historic capital of India personified by the Jama Masjid and Chandni Chowk (closed on Sundays). Take a food walk in the Chandni Chowk market. In Afternoon visit Humayun&rsquo;s Tomb and Qutub Minar. Overnight stay in Hotel Suncourt Yatri</p>
  
  <p><strong>Jama Masjid </strong>is a mosque in Old Delhi, constructed in 1650&ndash;56 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān, a noted patron of Islamic architecture whose most famous work is the Taj Mahal, in Agra.</p>
  
  <p>This vibrant market came to existence when the fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, shifted his capital from Agra to Shahjahanabad, now Old Delhi, in the mid 17th century. While Chandni Chowk or the moonlit square no longer bears the magnificence of the bygone era, its importance in the annals of Delhi will never be lost.</p>
  
  <p>The <strong>food walk in Old Delhi </strong>is a great experience to and the best way to see and taste Old Delhi. The dishes one can savor in Old Delhi Food Walk are large, thick and juicy jalebis, glistening with ghee; Aloo chaat crisp fried potato cutlets dunked in a melange of chutneys and smattered with onions and spices ; varieties of stuffed paranthas potato, onion, cottage cheese, cauliflower, radish, dry fruits and many more&hellip;.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Humanyun&rsquo;s Tomb </strong>was built in 1565 A.D. nine years after the death of Humayun, by his senior widow Bega Begam. Inside the walled enclosure the most notable features are the garden squares (chaharbagh) with pathways water channels, centrally located well proportional mausoleum topped by double dome.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Qutab Minar </strong>is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately after the defeat of Delhi&#39;s last Hindu kingdom. The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Day 3 : Drive to Nawalgarh</strong><br />

  <p><strong>Nawalgarh </strong>is a small no touristy town almost at the very centre of the Shekhawati region, and makes a great base for exploring. It boasts several fine havelis, a colourful, mostly pedestrianized bazaar and some excellent accommodation options.</p>
  
  <p>Built in 1902 on the eastern side of town, and known locally as &#39;Podar Haveli&#39;, this is one of the region&rsquo;s few buildings to have been thoroughly restored. The paintings of this haveli are defined in strong colours, and are the most vivid murals in town, although purists point to the fact that they have been simply repainted rather than restored.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Morarka Haveli Museum</strong>: This museum has well-presented original paintings, preserved for decades behind doorways blocked with cement. The inner courtyard hosts some gorgeous Ramayana scenes; look out for the slightly incongruous image of Jesus on the top storey, beneath the eaves in the courtyard&rsquo;s southeast corner.On the ground floor are galleries on Rajasthani culture, including costumes, turbans, musical instruments and models of Rajasthan&rsquo;s forts.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Day 4 : Drive to Gajner, en-route Bikaner</strong><br />
  After breakfast leave for Gajner, a journey of about 4hrs. En-route visit Junagarh Fort in Bikaner. Arrive and check-in at the hotel. Overnight stay in Gajner Palace.</p>

The fort complex consists of palaces, courtyards, pavilions and balconies. The walls palaces etc. are ornamented with carved stones, marbles, paintings and inlaid semi-precious stones. Each palace in the Junagarh fort complex was built by a different ruler over the centuries.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Gajner Palace : </strong>A lakeside palace-complex adjoining a sanctuary, in the middle of Thar desert beckons you. Gajner Palace is a jewel in the Thar Desert, built by HH Maharaja Sir Ganga Singh of Bikaner on the edge of a lake. The property was converted into a heritage hotel in 1976.<br />
  Lose yourself in this sprawling majestic palace, with its distinctive terraces and balconies; revered for its fabulous setting and unhurried way of life, explore a world of nature-walks, boat-rides, sanctuary dinners and desert safaris. Discover Rajasthan&rsquo;s &lsquo;best-kept secret&rsquo;, just 30-minutes&rsquo; drive away from Bikaner.</p>
  
  <p>The hotel&#39;s compound stretches over 6000 acres. The palace was primarily a hunting resort during the days of the British Raj and attracted several dignitaries, including the Prince of Wales in 1905, Governor General Lord Elgin, Lord Erwin in 1927 and Lord Mountbatten when he was Viceroy of India. The Imperial Sand Grouse shoots at Gajner Palace during the Christmas season was the most sought after invitation in the indian social calendar.</p>
  
  <p>Besides its panoramic landscape and architectural beauty, the Palace Complex also has the remnants of a historic railway station: this hunting resort was connected to Bikaner Palace by rail in 1922.</p>

Carefully laid out water bodies of moats and fountains, around the property provide that soothing ambience for a perfect get-away from the pandemonium of the city.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Day 7 : Drive Pali, en-route visit Jodhpur</strong><br />
  After breakfast leave for Pali, a journey of about 2hrs. En-route visit the Mehrangarh Fort and Jaswant Thada. Arrive and check-in at the homestay. Overnight stay in Cuture Aangan homestay in Pali.</p>

With Culture Aangan, you can take the opportunity &amp; connect with the people who contribute to the thickly woven, intrinsic social carpet. You will explore the villages of Rajasthan &amp; experience firsthand, the various mechanisms that tick the village life. Sip hot chai out of earthen cups as you watch the sunrise over the fields. After enjoying a leisurely home-cooked breakfast, explore the village on horse-back before stopping to watch a local artisan delicately create their masterpiece. As dusk approaches, head to the nearby jungle, gazing in anticipation at the lush foliage as a leopard graciously makes it way down the tree. Head back to the village and enjoy your evening meal whilst the villagers share folk songs and the children dance around you. You can be a part of the morning opium meet, go spend the day with the rabaaddi tribes, learn the art of block printing, and evenings watch the sun go down behind awe inspiring rock formations.</p>

  Built by Maharana Bhopal Singh Saheliyon ki Bari means Garden of the Maids. This garden area lies in northern part of the city and has fountains and kiosks, a lotus pool and marble elephants. Each water channel has its distinct sound and the mingling of these sounds complement the ambience of the place. Sahelion Ki Bari&#39; was laid for a group of forty-eight young women attendants who accompanied a princess to Udaipur as part of her dowry.</p>
  
  <p>Located 150meters north of the city palace built in Indo-Aryan architectural style, the Jagdish temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The temple walls and the shikara or tower are decorated with carvings of Vishnu, scenes from Lord Krishna&rsquo;s life and figurines of nymphs or apsaras.</p>
  
  <p>The grand City Palace, towering over the Pichola Lake, is one of the largest palace complex in Rajasthan.
